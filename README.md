# Movie Recommender System

A machine learning-based movie recommendation system using TMDB 5000 movie data from Kaggle. The project involves feature extraction, preprocessing, and generating movie recommendations, with a web interface built using Streamlit.

## Project Overview

- Jupyter Notebook: Used for data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, building the model, and generating assets.
- Streamlit App: Provides a user-friendly web interface for movie recommendations.
- Asset Export: Two essential `.pkl` files are saved after running the notebook to enable fast recommendations via the web app.

## Getting Started

### 1. Download the Dataset

- Download the `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` and `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` files from the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset on Kaggle].
- Place both CSV files in your working directory.

### 2. Run the Jupyter Notebook

- Open `Movie-recommendations.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda recommended).
- Ensure all required Python packages are installed:
- Run the notebook sequentially. After finishing all cells, execute the LAST TWO lines:
This will generate two required files: `movie_dict.pkl` and `similarity.pkl`.

### 3. Project Folder Setup

- Create a new folder for your web app using PyCharm, VSCode, or your preferred editor.
- Move `movie_dict.pkl` and `similarity.pkl` into this new folder.

### 4. Add the Web Application

- Write or copy the provided `app.py` file into this folder.
- Sample `app.py` skeleton (customize as needed):

### 5. Running the Application

- From terminal, with the new folder as working directory:
- The browser will launch with the Movie Recommender System interface.

## Project Structure

| File/Folder                  | Purpose                                          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Movie-recommendations.ipynb`| Data processing and model creation notebook       |
| `movie_dict.pkl`             | Pickled movie features generated by notebook      |
| `similarity.pkl`             | Pickled similarity matrix generated by notebook   |
| `app.py`                     | Streamlit web application                        |
| `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`, `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` | Original datasets (used only in preprocessing) |

## Notes

- Always generate fresh `.pkl` files if any preprocessing or feature logic changes.
- The notebook must be run before using the app for the first time (or after any dataset/model change).
